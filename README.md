# Osmo bootstrap template

Manually re-created Osmo shop homepage from the [original one](https://www.playosmo.com/en/). Сopyright of the content (images, videos etc.) belongs to the Tangible Play, Inc.

## Features

* Based on Bootstrap 4.1
* Responsive/Adaptive design
* Responsive images via HTML5 attributes and CSS3 media queries
* PostCSS plugins: Autoprefixer and UnCSS
* Play/pause videos depending on their position on the screen
* SVG sprite injected into HTML markup
* Gotham font was replaced by free alternative Montserrat

## Approach

I tried to follow the same code style and approach that is [recommended](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/extend/approach/) by the Bootstrap developers:

> * Components should be responsive and mobile-first
> * Components should be built with a base class and extended via modifier classes
> * Whenever possible, prefer a HTML and CSS implementation over JavaScript
> * Whenever possible, use utilities over custom styles
> * Whenever possible, avoid enforcing strict HTML requirements (children selectors)

Some other guides and approaches which I followed anyway:

* “6 Gulp Best Practices” by [Cosmin](http://blog.rangle.io/angular-gulp-bestpractices/)
* “HTML/CSS Style Guide” by [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
* “Principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS” by [Necolas](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
